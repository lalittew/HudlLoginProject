        b) LoginPage: This file contains tests related to Login page
2) This path for feature files is : /HudlLoginProject/Features

Note: For the valid login credentials I needed to register into website which i was not compeletely sure how I can do, hence I have not written
exclusive test for the same but can be easily written using the test "Verify that user is not able to login into Hudl on giving wrong email or password"
and replacing the last step with correct page expection and also by replacing invalid credentials with valid credential

How to run the tests:
1) There are two ways tests can be run:
        a) Go to TestRunner.java class and run TestRunner function by clicking green button next to it
        b) Create a Run configuration. This can be done by adding a Junit configuration using + button under edit configuration
        and selecting TestRunner class

Note:
TestRunner class can be found under path: /HudlLoginProject/src/main/java/testRunner
Make sure all the test having annotation same as defined in Test Runner class, for this project I have used "@testHudl" as an annotation
If the anootations above the test are not matching the one defined in TestRunner class it will skip those tests

2) Just drag and drop this "index.html" report in browser to view report


Bugs and issues found in desktop browser version: Tested in chrome(Version 104.0.5112.79)
1) Page title of Help page whoch opens by clicking "Need help?" is showing as "Log In"
2) On giving wrong credentials and clicking login button giving error message which also contains "Need help?" link . It is more of suggestion
because it may confuse user to display some other help page different from other need help page
3) Log in button text on Home page is different from Log In button text present in Login page
4) If there is any error happens like giving no value under email or password and clicking Login button then response code coming back is 200.
This I am not sure should be Http 200 or not as I am not sure on requirements
5) If user gives wrong email and password and click Login button , then user is getting Http 200 back , but may be user should get Http 401.
Again I am not sure on this how the requirements are around this.

Bugs and issues found in mobile browser version: I tested this in iPhone 13 Pro(15.6), in safari
1) Press Login button without entering any value
   Click in password or email text box
   Try scrolling
Bug: It will not let you scroll and Hudl logo will be half visible , while Sign Up button and back button will not be visible to user

2) In the login page put email in email text box and change the phone mode to landscape mode and then change back to portrait mode
Bug: This will change the UI of page completely and many fields will not be visible to user anymore unless user refresh page

3)When there is error providing invalid credentials there no fields are highlighted. This could be product requirement but I just wanted to highlight
this

4) Error message disappear as soon you type anything in text box, again this could be requirement but I just wanted to highlight
